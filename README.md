# EPOS_calibrator

Code for polarisation calibration of EPOS format file

1. This code works on an EPOS format file converted to a timer archive file compatible with PSRCHIVE. You can use the docker from https://hub.docker.com/r/prajwalvp/psrchive_epos for doing this coversion.

2. The sample code shown here uses works on an archive file of PSR J1022+1001 and applies a calibration procedure for an adding polarimeter. The equations for this can be found in Hoesnborch and Xilouris 1997 (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.896.9404&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
